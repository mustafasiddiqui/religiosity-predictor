    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, there has been a massive rise in the usage of dating apps to find love. Many of these apps use sophisticated data science techniques to recommend possible matches to users and to optimize the user experience. These apps give us access to a wealth of information that we’ve never had before about how different people experience romance\n",

    "The purpose of this project is to practice formulating questions and implementing machine learning techniques to solve a question\n",

    "### Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, the goal is to utilize the skills learned through Codecademy and apply machine learning techniques to a data set. \n",
    "\n",
    "The primary research question that will be answered is whether there is a link between other variables in their profiles and their religious commitment (or lack thereof).\n",
    "\n",
    "This project is important because the data affords us a look at answers that individuals would be more motivated to be accurate and truthful in reporting about themselves, as there is a major disincentive of not being so (i.e. not finding a suitable partner)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The project has one data set provided by Codecademy called profiles.csv. In the data, each row represents an OkCupid user and the columns are the responses to their user profiles which include multi-choice and short answer questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "This solution will use descriptive statistics and data visualization to find key figures in understanding the distribution, count, and relationship between variables. Since the goal of the project to make predictions on the user's religious commitment, classification algorithms from the supervised learning family of machine learning models will be implemented. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "The project will conclude with the evaluation of the machine learning model selected with a validation data set. The output of the predictions can be checked through a confusion matrix, and metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 and Kappa scores. \n"
